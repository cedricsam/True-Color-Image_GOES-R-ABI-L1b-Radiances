# True-Color-Image_GOES-R-ABI-L1b-Radiances

This script uses the GOES-16, GOES-17 or *GOES-19* ABI Level 1b Radiance product (publicly available) to create a georeferenced RGB True-Color image.

99.9% of the work here was from [main repo](https://github.com/daniellelosos/True-Color-Image_GOES-R-ABI-L1b-Radiances) by Danielle Losos.

Iâ€™ve added a few extra cells to deal with proxy, requirements and try reprojecting the image (lowers the quality).
